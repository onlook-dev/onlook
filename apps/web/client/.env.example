# Required Environment Variables for Onlook Web Client
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual API keys
# 
# CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE:
# 
# 1. DUPLICATE CONFIGURATIONS: The original .env file had 4 identical configuration 
#    blocks repeated, causing confusion and potential conflicts
# 
# 2. MISSING ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: The setup script (bun run setup:env) crashes during 
#    interactive prompts when this required variable is missing. The script expects
#    this key but doesn't handle its absence gracefully, leaving the system corrupted
# 
# 3. INCONSISTENT VARIABLE NAMING: Code expects CSB_API_KEY but documentation 
#    references CODESANDBOX_API_KEY - maintaining CSB_API_KEY for compatibility
# 
# 4. LACK OF GUIDANCE: Original file had minimal comments, making it unclear 
#    which variables are required vs optional for local development
# 
# 5. ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION FAILURES: Missing required keys caused env.ts 
#    validation to fail, preventing application startup

# Supabase Configuration (Required for database connectivity)
# These values work with the default local Supabase setup from 'bun supabase:start'
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_local_supabase_anon_key_here

# Database Connection (Required for Drizzle ORM)
# This connects to the local PostgreSQL instance started by Supabase
SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres

# Codesandbox API Key (Required for publish features)
# Get from https://codesandbox.io/dashboard
# Note: Using CSB_API_KEY to match existing code expectations
CSB_API_KEY=your_codesandbox_api_key_here

# Anthropic API Key (Required - CRITICAL FIX)
# Get from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
# BEFORE: This was missing, causing setup script crashes and env validation failures
# AFTER: Now included with clear guidance for local development vs production
# For local development: use placeholder like 'sk-placeholder-key-for-development'
# For full AI features: add your actual Anthropic API key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Optional API Keys for Enhanced Features
# These can be left empty for basic local development

# MorphLLM (Optional - for Fast Apply AI features)
MORPH_API_KEY=

# Relace (Optional - alternative to MorphLLM for Fast Apply AI features)
RELACE_API_KEY=
