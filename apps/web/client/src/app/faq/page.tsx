We have plans to bring many of your favorite design tool features such as layers, components, and more into the interface. And of course, we'll be continuing to enhance the AI capabilities of Onlook to make it faster to craft designs."

While it is best suited for creating websites, it can be used for anything visual â€“ presentations, mockups, and more. Because Onlook uses code as the source of truth, the types of designs you can create are unconstrained by Onlook's interface. "

                answer: "Both the founders come from either side of the design and development divide. We realized that AI could be the final leap to solve the problem of designers and developers work together. Onlook is a continuous iteration towards the new state-of-the-art for collaboration in code."
            },
            {
                question: "Why is Onlook open-source?",
                answer: "Developers have historically been second-rate citizens in the design process. Onlook was founded to bridge the divide between design and development, and we wanted to make developers first-class citizens alongside designers. We chose to be open-source to give developers transparency into how we are building Onlook and how the work created through Onlook will complement the work of developers."

                question: "Where is Onlook based?",
                answer: "Onlook was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, and started as a remote-first company between Cincinnati and New York City. After the YC Winter 2025 batch, Onlook opened a barracks in San Francisco. Our open-source contributors are scattered across the world, bringing their unique perspectives and incredible talent to the project as we continue to push the limits of design and development."
