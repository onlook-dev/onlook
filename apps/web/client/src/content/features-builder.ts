  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How does visual editing work with existing React projects?",
      answer: "Onlook integrates seamlessly with any React project using Tailwind CSS. Simply import your existing codebase and start editing visually. All changes are made directly to your actual code files, preserving your project structure and build process."
    },
    {
      question: "Will visual editing break my existing code?",
      answer: "No! Onlook only modifies the specific properties you change visually, leaving the rest of your code untouched. It follows React and Tailwind best practices to ensure generated code is clean and maintainable."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this with TypeScript projects?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Onlook fully supports TypeScript React projects. It understands your type definitions and ensures all generated code maintains proper TypeScript compatibility."
    },
    {
      question: "How does this compare to traditional design tools?",
      answer: "Unlike traditional design tools that create static mockups, Onlook works directly with your actual React components and generates real, functional code. You're not designing a representation of your app â€“ you're building the actual app."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my existing development workflow?",
      answer: "Your existing workflow remains unchanged. Onlook enhances your development process by adding visual capabilities while preserving your build tools, testing setup, and deployment pipeline."
    },
    {
      question: "Can multiple developers work on the same project?",
      answer: "Yes! Since Onlook works directly with your code files, it integrates perfectly with version control systems like Git. Multiple developers can collaborate using their preferred tools while some use visual editing."
