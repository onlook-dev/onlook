    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between Onlook and other design tools?",
      answer: "Onlook is a visual editor for code. It allows you to create and style your own creations with code as the source of truth. While it is best suited for creating websites, it can be used for anything visual â€“ presentations, mockups, and more. Because Onlook uses code as the source of truth, the types of designs you can create are unconstrained by Onlook interface."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is Onlook open-source?",
      answer: "Developers have historically been second-rate citizens in the design process. Onlook was founded to bridge the divide between design and development, and we wanted to make developers first-class citizens alongside designers. We chose to be open-source to give developers transparency into how we are building Onlook and how the work created through Onlook will complement the work of developers."
