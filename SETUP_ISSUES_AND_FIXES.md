# Onlook Setup Issues and Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the issues encountered during the Onlook local development setup process and the fixes that were applied to resolve them.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Interactive Setup Script Failure
**Issue**: The `bun run setup:env` command failed during the interactive API key prompts.

**Symptoms**:
- Script would reach the "Enter your Codesandbox API key:" prompt
- Input prompt would show `%` character and exit unexpectedly
- Environment files were created with duplicate entries
- API keys section was missing from the `.env` files

**Root Cause**: The `prompts` library used in the setup script crashed during interactive input collection.

### 2. Corrupted Environment Files
**Issue**: The failed setup script created `.env` files with duplicate entries.

**Affected Files**:
- `apps/web/client/.env` - Had 4 duplicate Supabase configuration blocks
- `packages/db/.env` - Had 4 duplicate database configuration blocks

### 3. Missing Required Environment Variables
**Issue**: The web client requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a mandatory environment variable, but setup script left it empty.

**Error Message**:
```
❌ Invalid environment variables: [
  {
    code: 'invalid_type',
    expected: 'string',
    received: 'undefined',
    path: [ 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' ],
    message: 'Required'
  }
]
```

### 4. Port Conflicts
**Issue**: Development server had conflicts on multiple ports.

**Symptoms**:
- Port 8083 (preload server) was already in use: `EADDRINUSE`
- Port 3000 (main app) was in use, automatically switched to port 3001

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Manual Environment File Cleanup
**Action**: Manually recreated clean environment files.

**Web Client `.env` file** (`apps/web/client/.env`):
```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[LOCAL_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY]

# Drizzle
SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres

# Codesandbox
CSB_API_KEY=[YOUR_CODESANDBOX_API_KEY]

# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-placeholder-key-for-development

# MorphLLM
MORPH_API_KEY=

# Relace
RELACE_API_KEY=
```

**Database `.env` file** (`packages/db/.env`):
```env
SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[LOCAL_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]
SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
```

### 2. Port Conflict Resolution
**Action**: 
- Killed any processes using conflicting ports
- Development server automatically used port 3001 when 3000 was unavailable

### 3. Added Required API Key Placeholders
**Action**: Added placeholder values for required API keys to prevent validation errors during development.

## Successful Setup Steps

After applying fixes, the following steps completed successfully:

1. ✅ **Database Schema**: `bun db:push` - Applied schema changes
2. ✅ **Database Seeding**: `bun db:seed` - Added test data
3. ✅ **Development Server**: `bun dev` - Started on `http://localhost:3001`
4. ✅ **Application Verification**: Onlook interface loads correctly with full functionality

## Recommended Documentation Updates

### 1. Setup Script Reliability
The current documentation should include:
- Alternative manual setup instructions if the interactive script fails
- Troubleshooting section for common script failures
- Clear indication of required vs optional API keys

### 2. Environment Variables Guide
Create a comprehensive guide listing:
- **Required variables**: `CSB_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **Optional variables**: `MORPH_API_KEY`, `RELACE_API_KEY`, etc.
- **Placeholder values** for development mode
- **Where to obtain each API key**

### 3. Port Configuration
Document:
- Default ports used by each service
- How to handle port conflicts
- Alternative port configuration options

---

**Title**: 🐛 Improve setup documentation and error handling for `bun run setup:env`

**Labels**: `documentation`, `bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`

**Description**:

## Problem
The current local development setup process has several reliability issues that prevent successful installation:

### Issues Encountered:
1. **Interactive setup script failure**: `bun run setup:env` crashes during API key prompts, leaving corrupted environment files
2. **Environment validation errors**: Required environment variables not clearly documented, causing startup failures
3. **Port conflicts**: No guidance for handling port conflicts during development
4. **Missing troubleshooting**: No recovery instructions when setup fails

### Impact:
- New contributors cannot easily set up local development environment
- Setup script leaves system in broken state requiring manual intervention
- Unclear which API keys are required vs optional for basic functionality

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Documentation Improvements
- [ ] Add comprehensive troubleshooting section to README.md
- [ ] Create dedicated `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` with clear required/optional distinctions
- [ ] Document port configuration and conflict resolution
- [ ] Add manual setup fallback instructions

### 2. Setup Script Enhancements
- [ ] Improve error handling in interactive prompts
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed operations
- [ ] Validate environment file creation
- [ ] Clear error messages for missing required keys

### 3. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Document placeholder values for development mode
- [ ] Clarify which services require real API keys vs can work with placeholders
- [ ] Add environment validation before service startup

### Example Error Messages Encountered:
```
❌ Invalid environment variables: [
  {
    code: 'invalid_type',
    expected: 'string',
    received: 'undefined',
    path: [ 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' ],
    message: 'Required'
  }
]
```

```
error: Failed to start server. Is port 8083 in use?
```

### Files That Need Updates:
- `README.md` - Add troubleshooting section
- `packages/scripts/src/api-keys.ts` - Improve error handling
- `packages/scripts/src/index.ts` - Add validation
- `docs/` - Add comprehensive environment variables guide

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] New users can successfully complete setup on first try
- [ ] Clear guidance when setup script fails
- [ ] Environment requirements clearly documented
- [ ] Port conflicts are handled gracefully

### Technical Details & Fixes Applied

The following technical fixes were successfully implemented to resolve the setup issues:

#### 1. Environment File Corruption Fix
**Problem**: Setup script created multiple duplicate entries in both `.env` files
**Solution**:
- Manually recreate clean environment files with single entries
- Remove all duplicate Supabase configuration blocks
- Ensure proper formatting and line endings

#### 2. Required API Key Validation Fix
**Problem**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` marked as required in `apps/web/client/src/env.ts:35` but left empty
**Root Cause**: The environment validation schema expects all required keys to have values
**Solution**:
- Add placeholder value for development: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-placeholder-key-for-development`
- Or update schema to make optional during development mode

#### 3. Port Conflict Resolution
**Problem**: Port 8083 (preload server) already in use causing `EADDRINUSE` errors
**Solution**:
- Kill existing processes on conflicting ports: `lsof -ti:8083 | xargs -r kill -9`
- Restart development server which auto-detects available ports
- Main app successfully runs on port 3001 when 3000 is occupied

#### 4. Successful Setup Sequence
After applying fixes, this sequence works reliably:
```bash
# 1. Ensure clean environment files (manual step currently needed)
# 2. Initialize database schema
bun db:push

# 3. Seed database with test data
bun db:seed

# 4. Start development server
bun dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001 (or 3000 if available)
```

#### 5. Critical Files Modified
- `apps/web/client/.env` - Clean single-entry configuration with required placeholders
- `packages/db/.env` - Clean database configuration without duplicates

#### 6. Environment Schema Analysis
The issue stems from strict validation in `apps/web/client/src/env.ts`:
- Line 35: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: z.string()` (required, no `.optional()`)
- Line 11: `CSB_API_KEY: z.string()` (required)
- Missing placeholder handling for development mode

**Proposed Code Changes for Maintainers:**
1. Update environment schema to support development mode placeholders
2. Add validation in setup script to ensure all required keys have values
3. Implement proper error handling in interactive prompts
4. Add cleanup logic to prevent duplicate environment entries

**Additional Context:**
This issue was identified during a fresh installation attempt where the interactive setup script crashed, leaving duplicate environment entries and missing required API keys. Manual intervention was required to complete the setup successfully.
