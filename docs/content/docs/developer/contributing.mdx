3. Update the PR description with details of the changes. Link the issue if relevant.

4. Be sure to check the box to "Allow edits from maintainer". This allows maintainers to update your PR if necessary which speeds up the review process. [See more here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

## Style guide

We try to follow guidelines from [Clean Code](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29) and the boy scoute rule:

"Leave the code cleaner, not messier, than how you found it". 

## Testing
We use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for testing.

```bash
bun test
```

## Linting

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting. This runs on every commit.

```bash
bun lint
bun format
```

## Type safety

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety.

To check types of the web client, run:
```bash
cd apps/web/client && bun run typecheck
```
