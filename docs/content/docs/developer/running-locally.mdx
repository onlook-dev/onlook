# Running Onlook Locally

This guide will set you up with running Onlook locally. This involves a Next.js app, a Supabase backend, and the ability to run the dev containers with Codesandbox.

## Prerequisites

These are the prerequisites for running Onlook locally.

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - Enables running the monorepo
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) - Enables running the Supabase backend

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook.git
   cd onlook
   ```

### 2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

### 3. Run backend

   Make sure you have Docker running from the instructions above.

   ```bash
   bun backend:start
   ```

    Grab the `anon key` and `service role key` from the output. We'll use these in step 5 and 7.

### 4. Get API keys

#### a. Get Codesandbox API key

    Request an API key from Codesandbox. This is used to run the dev containers. It should be free to use. https://codesandbox.io/api

    Note: We plan on enabling running the dev containers with Docker Desktop in the future after we figure out the best api. 

#### b. Get Anthropic API key

    Request an API key from Anthropic. This is used for chatting with your project. https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

### 5. Set environment variables

Run the interactive environment setup script:

```bash
bun run setup:env
```

Note: If you'd prefer manually setting up the environment variables, see the [appendix](/docs/developer/appendix) for instructions.

### 6. Initialize the database

Set up the database schema
   ```bash
   bun db:push
   ```

### 7. Seed the database with test data

Seed the database with test data. This will create test users and projects.
   ```bash
   bun db:seed
   ```

### 8. Run development server

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app running. You're all set!
