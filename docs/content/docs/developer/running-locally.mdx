# Running Onlook Locally

This guide will set you up with running Onlook locally. This involves a Next.js app, a Supabase backend, and the ability to run the dev containers with Codesandbox.

## Prerequisites

These are the prerequisites for running Onlook locally.

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - Enables running the monorepo
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) - Enables running the Supabase backend
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) â€“ Minimum version `v20.16.0` or latest

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook.git
   cd onlook
   ```

### 2. Install dependencies

From the root directory, run:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

Note: As mentioned earlier, some API keys are optional, but missing them will limit functionality. If you skip an optional API key, the setup script will show warnings but continue.

### 3. Run backend

   Make sure you have Docker running from the instructions above.

   ```bash
   bun backend:start
   ```

    Grab the `anon key` and `service role key` from the output. We'll use these in step 5 and 7.

### 4. Get API keys

#### a. Get E2B API key

1. Go to [E2B Dashboard](https://e2b.dev)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to your API keys section
4. Create a new API key or copy an existing one

Note: As mentioned earlier, some API keys are optional, but missing them will limit functionality. If you skip an optional API key, the setup script will show warnings but continue.

#### b. Get Anthropic API key

    Request an API key from Anthropic. This is used for chatting with your project. https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

#### c. Get Fast Apply API key

    For applying AI code, SOTA is to use fast apply models in order to resolve the code change. There are two options for Fast Apply providers:

    - [MorphLLM](https://morphllm.com/dashboard)
    - [Relace](https://app.relace.ai/settings/api-keys)

    You only need to get one of the keys and set it in the environment variables in later steps.

### 5. Set environment variables

Run the interactive environment setup script:

```bash
bun run setup:env
```

Note: If you'd prefer manually setting up the environment variables, see the [appendix](/docs/developer/appendix) for instructions.

### 6. Initialize the database

Set up the database schema. You will need to run this command every time there's a change to the database schema.

Note: If prompted for interaction such as choosing an option, cd into `apps/db` and run `bun run db:push` to use interactive mode.
   ```bash
   bun db:push
   ```

### 7. Seed the database with test data

Seed the database with test data. This will create test users and projects.
   ```bash
   bun db:seed
   ```

### 8. Run development server

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app running. You're all set!

## Common Issues

#### E2B Sandbox Preview

If you encounter issues with the E2B sandbox preview not loading, make sure:
1. Your E2B API key is valid and active
2. You have sufficient credits in your E2B account 
3. Check the browser console for any error messages

#### Refreshing pages

If you encounter issues with reloading pages and being unauthenticated then check your node version, install a more recent version, re-install dependencies and restart the project.
Minimum version `v20.16.0` or latest is recommended.

Avoid version `v20.11.0` of Node as it has shown this issue in the past.

```bash
node --version
```
