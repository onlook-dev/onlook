# Onlook Architecture

Onlook is structured as a monorepo with several interconnected apps and packages, primarily built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Directory Structure

```

## Communication Architecture

The application uses a three-tier communication architecture:

- **Client**: Contains the UI and user interaction logic
- **Server**: Handles file system operations, project execution, AI communication, and deployment
- **Webviews**: Display the actual web content being edited

Communication between these layers happens through:

- **API Endpoints**: REST APIs for client-server communication
- **WebviewChannels**: Communication between the client and webviews

## Build and CI/CD

The application is built using a combination of:
- **Next.js**: For frontend development and bundling
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD, defined in `.github/workflows/build.yml`

The build pipeline handles:
- Building the application for multiple platforms (macOS, Windows)
- Code signing and notarization 
- Releasing to GitHub Releases
