*Transform your Figma designs into working code with Onlook*

## Why This Integration Changes Everything

Designers no longer have to stop at mockups. With Onlook, you can:

- Transform Figma designs into clean, structured React components
- Make your designs interactive and functional
- Connect your UI to real data sources
- Deploy your work as a fully functional application

## How do I import Figma Designs into Onlook?

### 1. Structure Your Figma Design

For smooth importing, your Figma file needs to be well-organized. Here's how to prepare:

#### Use Auto-Layout

- Apply Auto-Layout to all parent containers
- Use proper padding, spacing, and resizing rules
- Set horizontal/vertical resizing for responsive layouts

#### Name Your Layers Clearly

- Use descriptive names like `Header`, `CTA Button`, `Nav Bar`â€”not `Frame 23`
- Avoid symbols and nested clutter
- Group similar components logically

*Properly named layers make for better code generation*

#### Build Reusable Components

- Use consistent styling (fonts, colors, etc.)
- Turn repeated elements into Figma components

#### Think in Design Systems

- Apply global styles
- Use a shared component library if available

You'll need to be on Figma's Professional or Developer Plan to use the Import from Figma MCP feature.

### 2. Setup the Figma connection
1. Open Figma desktop and make sure you're on the latest version of Figma by clicking the "Figma" menu item in the upper left corner and selecting the "Check for Updates" menu item.

2. Open a Figma design or create a new one that you'd like to use as a reference for Onlook.
3. Select the Figma logo in the upper left corner to open the menu. 
4. Under Preferences, select "Enable Dev Mode MCP Server." You should see a confirmation message at the bottom of the screen letting you know the server is enabled and running.


### 3. Import your design into Onlook.

Once you have the connection established, there are two ways you can import your design into Onlook: 
1. Link-based
2. Selection-based

#### Link-based import
1. Copy the link to a frame or layer in Figma.

2. Prompt your client to help you implement the design. 


#### Selection-based import

1. Select a frame or layer inside Figma using the desktop app. Click the "Add Selected Frame from Figma" button to add it to your prompt. Your design will be added as a badge above the prompt box when it has been successfully attached to the prompt.

2. Prompt your client to help you implement your current selection. When you submit your prompt, the design context will be included automatically.

* Add animations to this design.
* Make this design interactive.
* Add missing elements to this design.
* Rewrite the copy to be simpler or easier to understand.

### 4. Deploy Your App
