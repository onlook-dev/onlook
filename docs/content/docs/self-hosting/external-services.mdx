# External Services

Onlook requires several external services to provide its features. Each of these services is self-hostable under Apache 2.0 or equivalently permissive licenses.

## Services Overview

### Required Services
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)** - Database and authentication backend

### Optional Services
- **AI Providers** - Any provider from the [AI SDK providers](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) can be added on request
- **Sandbox Providers** - We are working to add [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B) as a self-hosted alternative to CodeSandbox

## Self-hosting Guides

For assistance with self-hosting these services, please contact us at [founders@onlook.com](mailto:founders@onlook.com).

### Supabase
Follow the official [Supabase self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) to deploy with Docker.

### E2B
Deploy E2B to GCP using their [self-hosting guide](https://github.com/e2b-dev/infra/blob/main/self-host.md).

### AI Providers
To configure custom AI providers:
1. Update the providers in [`packages/ai/src/chat/providers.ts`](https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook/blob/main/packages/ai/src/chat/providers.ts)
2. Update the usages by searching for [`initModel`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aonlook-dev%2Fonlook%20initModel&type=code)
