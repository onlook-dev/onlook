# Admin Dashboard

The Onlook admin dashboard is an optional component for self-hosted deployments that provides comprehensive management capabilities for your Onlook instance.

## Overview

The admin dashboard allows you to:

- **User Management**: View and manage user accounts, projects, and access
- **Subscription Management**: Handle user subscriptions and pricing tiers
- **Rate Limit Management**: Monitor and adjust API rate limits for users
- **Deployment Tracking**: View and manage user deployments
- **Domain Management**: Manage custom domains and verification status
- **Product & Pricing**: Configure available products and pricing tiers

## Availability

The admin dashboard is available for self-hosting setups and is maintained in a separate private repository. This component is optional - the core Onlook application functions independently without it.

### Security

- Authentication can be configured per deployment
- Separate from user-facing application
- Access should be restricted to internal team members
