# Self-Hosting Onlook

Onlook provides flexible self-hosting options for organizations that need complete control over their visual development environment. Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure and requirements.

**Best for:**
- Small to medium teams (5-50 users)
- Simple production deployments
- Cost-conscious organizations
- Teams wanting direct control without containers
