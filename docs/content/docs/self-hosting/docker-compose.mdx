# Docker Compose

Deploy Onlook using Docker Compose on VMs or local machines. This is a simple, single-container deployment designed for small teams and basic self-hosting needs. For enterprise-grade deployments requiring high availability and scalability, use the [Cloud Deployment](/self-hosting/cloud-deployment) option.

## Prerequisites

**System Requirements:**
- 4+ CPU cores
- 8GB+ RAM (16GB recommended)
- 50GB+ available disk space
- Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+

**Software Requirements:**
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - Package manager and runtime
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v20.16.0+ (avoid v20.11.0)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Basic Deployment

> **Note**: This is a simple deployment suitable for small teams and testing. For development, use `bun dev` in the repository root.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook.git
cd onlook

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### 2. Setup Environment Variables

For Docker Compose deployment, you need to create a production environment file. Choose one of these approaches:

**Option A: Use Interactive Setup Script**

```bash

# Run interactive environment setup
bun run setup:env

# Copy the generated .env to .env.production for Docker
cp apps/web/client/.env .env.production
```

**Option B: Copy from Example and Configure Manually**

```bash
# Copy example file and edit with your values
cp apps/web/client/.env.example apps/web/client/.env
# Edit apps/web/client/.env with your API keys and configuration

# Copy to production environment for Docker
cp apps/web/client/.env .env.production
```

**Required variables for production:**
- **Supabase**: Production database URL and API keys
- **OpenRouter API Key**: For AI chat features  
- **CodeSandbox Token**: For development containers
- **Fast Apply Provider**: Choose MorphLLM or Relace for AI code changes

For detailed instructions on obtaining these API keys, see the [development setup guide](/developers/running-locally#3-get-api-keys).

### 3. Start Backend Services

```bash
bun backend:start
```

This starts Supabase locally with PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage.

### 4. Initialize Database

```bash
# Push database schema
bun db:push

# Seed with initial data (optional for production)
bun db:seed
```

### 5. Deploy with Docker Compose

Deploy the production container from the repository root:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This builds and starts:
- **Web Application**: Production-built Next.js application (port 3000)
- **Health checks**: Automatic container health monitoring
- **Auto-restart**: Container restarts automatically on failure

**Note**: The Docker container uses `network_mode: "host"` to access the local Supabase services running on your host machine. This allows the container to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:54321` (Supabase API) and `127.0.0.1:54322` (PostgreSQL).

### 6. Verify Deployment

- **Main Application**: http://localhost:3000
- **Supabase Dashboard**: http://localhost:54323 (from backend:start)

Check the service is running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## Additional Setup (Optional)

### SSL/TLS for Remote Access

If deploying on a remote server with a domain:

```bash
# Install Nginx and Certbot
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Configure reverse proxy
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/onlook
```

Add this configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

```bash
# Enable site and get SSL certificate
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/onlook /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

## Management

### Updates

```bash
# Pull latest changes and rebuild
git pull origin main
bun install
# Update production environment if needed
cp apps/web/client/.env .env.production
# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check status and logs
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f web
curl http://localhost:3000
```

### Backup

```bash
# Database backup
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -d onlook > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**
- **Missing .env.production**: Copy your `.env` file to `.env.production` before running docker-compose
- **Port 3000 in use**: Stop other services or change port  
- **Docker build fails**: Run `docker system prune` and retry
- **Database connection**: Verify `bun backend:start` is running and Supabase is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:54321
- **Container can't connect to Supabase**: Ensure `network_mode: "host"` is set in docker-compose.yml for localhost access

## Limitations & Considerations

**This deployment is designed for simplicity, not high reliability:**

**Limitations:**
- Single container (single point of failure)
- No built-in load balancing or auto-scaling  
- Manual backup and disaster recovery
- Limited to vertical scaling only
- No high availability guarantees

**Suitable for:**
- Small teams (< 10 users)
- Development/testing environments
- Proof of concept deployments
- Basic self-hosting needs

**Not suitable for:**
- Mission-critical production workloads
- Large teams requiring high availability
- Environments needing 99.9%+ uptime

For enterprise-grade deployments, use the [Cloud Deployment](/self-hosting/cloud-deployment) option with proper redundancy and scaling.
