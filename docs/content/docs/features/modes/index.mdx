## Available Modes

### Visual Edit Mode

Visual Edit Mode allows you to manipulate elements directly in the browser, similar to design tools like Figma. In this mode, you can:

- Select and resize elements
- Drag and drop components
- Modify text and images
- Apply styles using a visual interface

This mode is perfect for designers who want to make quick visual adjustments without touching code.

## Switching Between Modes

You can switch between modes using the mode selector in the top toolbar. Your changes are synchronized across all modes, so you can switch freely without losing any work.

## Best Practices

For the best Onlook experience:

- Use **Visual Edit Mode** for layout and styling adjustments
- Switch to **Code Mode** for adding custom logic and functionality
- Use **AI Mode** to accelerate development or overcome challenges

Remember that all modes are working with the same underlying project, just providing different ways to interact with it.
