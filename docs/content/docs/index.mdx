# Welcome to Onlook!

Onlook is a "Cursor for Designers" that enables designers to make live edits to React and TailwindCSS projects directly within the browser DOM. It provides a seamless integration between design and development.

*Onlook's intuitive design interface lets you edit React components visually*

## What is Onlook?

<div className="relative h-[500px] overflow-hidden">
  <iframe
    className="absolute top-0 left-0 h-full w-full"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjFBUkVfy1E"
    title="Cursor for Designers"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

Onlook lets you:

- Edit designs directly in a browser-like interface
- Have changes automatically reflected in the code
- Use AI assistance to generate and modify code
- Manage project styling through a theme system
- Deploy websites directly from the application

With Onlook, designers can take control of implementation, reducing the gap between design and development. Create production-ready code without requiring deep coding knowledge.
