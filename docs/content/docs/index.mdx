Onlook is a "Cursor for Designers" that enables designers to make live edits to React and TailwindCSS projects directly within the browser DOM. It provides a seamless integration between design and development, allowing you to:

- Edit designs directly in a browser-like interface
- Have changes automatically reflected in the code
- Use AI assistance to generate and modify code
- Manage project styling through a theme system
- Deploy websites directly from the application
