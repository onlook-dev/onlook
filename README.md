## Getting Started

Available soon with a [hosted app](https://onlook.com) or
[run locally](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/running-locally).

### Usage

Onlook will run on any Next.js + TailwindCSS project, import your project
through V0, Figma, etc. into Onlook

Use the chat to create or edit a project you're working on. At any time, you can
always right-click an element to open up the exact location of the element in
code. Just be sure to choose your preferred IDE in the upper-right Corner of the
screen.

## How it works

<img width="676" alt="architecture" src="assets/architecture.png">

1. When you create an app, we load the code into a web container
2. The container runs and serves the code
3. Our editor receives the preview link and displays it in an iFrame
4. Our editor reads and indexes the code from the container
5. We instrument the code in order to map elements to their place in code
6. When the element is edited, we edit the element in our iFrame, then in code
7. Our AI chat also has code access and tools to understand and edit the code

This architecture can theoretically scale to any language or framework that
displays DOM elements declaratively (e.g. jsx/tsx/html). We are currently
focused on making it work well with Next.js and TailwindCSS.

[Architecture Docs](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/architecture)
