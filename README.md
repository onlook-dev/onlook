# The Cursor for Designers â€“ an Open-Source, Visual-First Code Editor

Craft websites, prototypes, and designs with AI in Next.js + TailwindCSS. Make
edits directly in the browser DOM with a visual editor. Design in realtime with
code. An open-source alternative to Bolt.new, Lovable, V0, Replit Agent, Figma
Make, Webflow, etc.

### Onlook for Desktop (aka Onlook Alpha)

We're in early preview for Onlook Web. If you're looking for the downloadable
desktop electron app, it's moved to
[Onlook Desktop](https://github.com/onlook-dev/desktop).

Why are we moving to the web? Read about our decision:
[Migrating from Electron to Web](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/electron-to-web-migration)

## Getting Started

Available soon with a [hosted app](https://onlook.com) or
[run locally](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/running-locally).

### Usage

Onlook will run on any Next.js + TailwindCSS project, import your project
through into Onlook or start from scratch within the editor.

Use the AI chat to create or edit a project you're working on. At any time, you
can always right-click an element to open up the exact location of the element
in code.

<br>

Draw-in new divs and re-arrange them within their parent containers by
dragging-and-dropping.

<br>

Preview the code side-by-side with your site design.

Use Onlook's editor toolbar to adjust Tailwind styles, directly manipulate
objects, and experiment with layouts.

## How it works

<img width="676" alt="architecture" src="assets/architecture.png">

1. When you create an app, we load the code into a web container
2. The container runs and serves the code
3. Our editor receives the preview link and displays it in an iFrame
4. Our editor reads and indexes the code from the container
5. We instrument the code in order to map elements to their place in code
6. When the element is edited, we edit the element in our iFrame, then in code
7. Our AI chat also has code access and tools to understand and edit the code

This architecture can theoretically scale to any language or framework that
displays DOM elements declaratively (e.g. jsx/tsx/html). We are focused on
making it work well with Next.js and TailwindCSS for now.

For a full walkthrough, check out our
[Architecture Docs](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/architecture).
