# Onlook supports Vite/Remix projects!
## Vite

This project a template/demo that showcases how you can edit your Remix project with Onlook.

The steps to do this are
### 1. Install the Vite plugin for React project and the Onlook Babel transform:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @vitejs/plugin-react @onlook/babel-plugin-react 
```

The Onlook Babel transform adds metadata to JSX elements, which makes it possible for Onlook to modify them.


### 2. Update the `vite.config.js` to the following:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // ... your existing plugins
    react({
      babel: {
        plugins: ["@onlook/babel-plugin-react"],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

For an example, see `vite.config.js` in this project.


### 3. Run your project and open the url in Onlook
Run you project as you usually do (by default, just write `vite` in terminal), and Vite will run your project on `localhost`, for example `localhost:5173` (as it for me):

After that, you can easily open your project in Onlook, just write the url your project running at (for me it's `localhost:5173`):

# Welcome to Remix!

- ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
