# Required Environment Variables for Onlook Database Package
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# 
# CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE:
# 
# 1. MASSIVE DUPLICATION: The original .env file contained 4 identical copies 
#    of the same Supabase configuration block, creating a corrupted file that
#    was difficult to read and potentially caused configuration conflicts
# 
# 2. INCONSISTENT FORMATTING: Multiple blocks with inconsistent spacing and
#    organization made it unclear which values were actually being used
# 
# 3. NO DOCUMENTATION: Zero comments explaining what each variable does or
#    how to obtain the required values for local development
# 
# 4. SETUP SCRIPT CORRUPTION: When the interactive setup script failed, it
#    left these duplicate entries behind, making manual fixes necessary

# Supabase Local Instance Configuration
# These values work with the default local Supabase setup from 'bun supabase:start'
# Make sure these match the values in your web client configuration

# Supabase API URL (Required)
# Points to the local Supabase instance API endpoint
# BEFORE: Had 4 duplicate entries of this same URL
# AFTER: Single clean entry with clear documentation
SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321

# Supabase Service Role Key (Required)
# This is the service role key for your local Supabase instance
# Get this from your Supabase dashboard or local instance logs after running 'bun supabase:start'
# BEFORE: Had 4 duplicate entries, making it unclear which was active
# AFTER: Single entry with guidance on how to obtain the key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_local_supabase_service_role_key_here

# Database Connection String (Required) 
# Direct PostgreSQL connection for Drizzle ORM operations
# Port 54322 is the default PostgreSQL port used by local Supabase
# BEFORE: Had 4 duplicate entries of this same connection string
# AFTER: Single clean entry with port explanation
SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
