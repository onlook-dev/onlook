USER: Create a new TodoList component with basic functionality
ASSISTANT: Let's create a new TodoList component with basic functionality:
1. Create the TodoList component with state management
2. Add the ability to toggle todo items
3. Include basic styling

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

```tsx

import { useState } from 'react';

interface Todo {

    { id: 1, text: 'Learn React', completed: false },

USER: Refactor the TodoList by extracting the TodoItem into its own component
ASSISTANT: Let's refactor the TodoList by extracting the TodoItem into its own component:
1. Create a new TodoItem component
2. Move the item rendering logic to the new component
3. Update the TodoList to use the new component

</example-conversation><example-summary-output>EXAMPLE SUMMARY:
Files Discussed:
/src/components/TodoList.tsx
/src/components/TodoItem.tsx
/src/hooks/useTodoState.tsx
/src/types/todo.d.ts
/src/api/todoService.ts
/src/styles/components.css

Project Context:
- Building a production-ready React Todo application with TypeScript
- Implementing a feature-rich task management system with categories, priorities, and due dates
- Application needs to support offline storage with IndexedDB and sync when online
- UI follows the company's design system with accessibility requirements (WCAG AA)

Implementation Details:
- Created custom hook useTodoState for centralized state management using useReducer
- Implemented optimistic updates for adding/deleting todos to improve perceived performance
- Added drag-and-drop functionality with react-dnd for reordering todos
- Set up API integration with JWT authentication and request caching
- Implemented debounced search functionality for filtering todos
- Created recursive TodoList component for handling nested sub-tasks
- Added keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Alt+N for new todo, etc.)
- Set up error boundaries for graceful failure handling

User Preferences:
- Uses Tailwind CSS with custom theme extending company design system
- Prefers functional components with hooks over class components
- Follows explicit type declarations with discriminated unions for state
- Prefers custom hooks for shared logic over HOCs or render props
- Uses React Query for server state and React Context for UI state
- Prefers async/await syntax over Promises for readability

Current Status:
- Core CRUD functionality is working with IndexedDB persistence
- Currently implementing filters by category and due date
- Having issues with the drag-and-drop performance on large lists
- Next priority is implementing the sync mechanism with backend
- Need to improve accessibility for keyboard navigation in nested todos</example-summary-output>
