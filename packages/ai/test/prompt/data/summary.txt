USER: Create a new TodoList component with basic functionality
ASSISTANT: Let's create a new TodoList component with basic functionality:
1. Create the TodoList component with state management
2. Add the ability to toggle todo items
3. Include basic styling

Here's the updated code:

/path/to/your/project/components/TodoList.tsx
```tsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
import { useState } from 'react';

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

export function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([
    { id: 1, text: 'Learn React', completed: false },
    { id: 2, text: 'Build Todo App', completed: false },
  ]);

  const toggleTodo = (id: number) => {
    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>
      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
    ));
  };

  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id} className="flex items-center gap-2 p-2">
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={todo.completed}
            onChange={() => toggleTodo(todo.id)}
          />
          <span className={todo.completed ? 'line-through' : ''}>
            {todo.text}
          </span>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

USER: Refactor the TodoList by extracting the TodoItem into its own component
ASSISTANT: Let's refactor the TodoList by extracting the TodoItem into its own component:
1. Create a new TodoItem component
2. Move the item rendering logic to the new component
3. Update the TodoList to use the new component

Here's the updated code:

/path/to/your/project/components/TodoItem.tsx
```tsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
interface TodoItemProps {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
  onToggle: (id: number) => void;
}

export function TodoItem({ id, text, completed, onToggle }: TodoItemProps) {
  return (
    <li className="flex items-center gap-2 p-2">
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={completed}
        onChange={() => onToggle(id)}
      />
      <span className={completed ? 'line-through' : ''}>
        {text}
      </span>
    </li>
  );
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

/path/to/your/project/components/TodoList.tsx
```tsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { useState } from 'react';
=======
import { useState } from 'react';
import { TodoItem } from './TodoItem';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

/path/to/your/project/components/TodoList.tsx
```tsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id} className="flex items-center gap-2 p-2">
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={todo.completed}
            onChange={() => toggleTodo(todo.id)}
          />
          <span className={todo.completed ? 'line-through' : ''}>
            {todo.text}
          </span>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
=======
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => (
        <TodoItem
          key={todo.id}
          {...todo}
          onToggle={toggleTodo}
        />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );

</example-conversation><example-summary-output>EXAMPLE SUMMARY:
Files Discussed:
/src/components/TodoList.tsx
/src/components/TodoItem.tsx
/src/hooks/useTodoState.tsx
/src/types/todo.d.ts
/src/api/todoService.ts
/src/styles/components.css

Project Context:
- Building a production-ready React Todo application with TypeScript
- Implementing a feature-rich task management system with categories, priorities, and due dates
- Application needs to support offline storage with IndexedDB and sync when online
- UI follows the company's design system with accessibility requirements (WCAG AA)

Implementation Details:
- Created custom hook useTodoState for centralized state management using useReducer
- Implemented optimistic updates for adding/deleting todos to improve perceived performance
- Added drag-and-drop functionality with react-dnd for reordering todos
- Set up API integration with JWT authentication and request caching
- Implemented debounced search functionality for filtering todos
- Created recursive TodoList component for handling nested sub-tasks
- Added keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Alt+N for new todo, etc.)
- Set up error boundaries for graceful failure handling

User Preferences:
- Uses Tailwind CSS with custom theme extending company design system
- Prefers functional components with hooks over class components
- Follows explicit type declarations with discriminated unions for state
- Prefers custom hooks for shared logic over HOCs or render props
- Uses React Query for server state and React Context for UI state
- Prefers async/await syntax over Promises for readability

Current Status:
- Core CRUD functionality is working with IndexedDB persistence
- Currently implementing filters by category and due date
- Having issues with the drag-and-drop performance on large lists
- Next priority is implementing the sync mechanism with backend
- Need to improve accessibility for keyboard navigation in nested todos</example-summary-output>
