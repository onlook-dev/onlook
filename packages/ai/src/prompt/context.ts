Missing dependencies ("command not found" errors) â†’ Suggest "npm install" to install the dependencies for the first time
Missing closing tags in JSX/TSX files. Make sure all the tags are closed.

The errors might have the same root cause. Analyze all the messages before suggesting solutions. If there is no solution, don't suggest a fix.
If the same error is being reported multiple times, the previous fix did not work. Try a different approach.

NEVER SUGGEST THE "npm run dev" command. Asumme the user is already running the app.`;
