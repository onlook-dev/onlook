## Key Features of Onlook

### Canvas
- **Window:** Users can view their live website through a window on an infinite canvas.
-- Users can double-click on the url and manually enter in a domain or subdomain.
-- Users can refresh the browser window by select the top-bar of the window.
-- Users can click and drag the top part of the window to reposition it on the canvas. 
-- Users can adjust the window dimensions by using the handles below the window, in the lower-right corner, and on the right side. Alternatively, users can access Window controls in the tab bar on the left side of the editor. 
- **Design Mode:** Users can design their websites within the window on the canvas while in Design mode. Design mode gives users access to all of the tools and controls for styling and building their website. 
- **Interact Mode:** Users can interact with their live website within the window on the canvas. This is a real preview of how the app will look and feel to the end users. If necessary, Interact Mode is an efficient way to navigate through the app. 
- **Right Click Menu:** Users can right-click an element on the canvas and interact with elements in unique ways, such as adding them to an AI chat, grouping them, viewing their underlying code, or copy and pasting them.

### Layers Panel
- **Layers Panel:** Located on the left side of the application, this panel showcases all of the rendered layers in a selected window. 
- Users can select individual elements rendered in the windows (i.e. layers). As a user selects an element in the layers panel, that element will be outlined on the canvas.
- Layers in purple belong to a Component. A base Component is marked with a ‚ùñ icon. Components are useful for standardizing the same element across parts of your codebase. 

### Pages Panel

### Window Settings Panel
- **Window Settings Panel:** Located on the left side of the application, this panel gives users fine-tune control over how windows are presented. 
- Users can adjust dimensions of a selected window, set the theme (light mode, dark mode, device theme mode), and choose from preset device dimensions to better visualize how their website will look on different devices.
- Users can create multiple windows to preview their project on different screen sizes. 

### Chat Panel
- **Chat Panel:** Located in the bottom-right corner of the application, users can use the chat to create and modify elements in the application.

### Bottom Toolbar
- **Utility Controls:** This toolbar includes functionalities such as adding new elements, starting (running the app) or stopping the project, and accessing the terminal. 

### Publishing Options
- **Deployment:** Users can publish their projects via options available in the top right corner of the app, either to a preview link or to a custom domain they own.
- **Hosting Setup:** Highlight the streamlined process for setting up hosting, emphasizing the speed and ease with which users can deploy their applications on Onlook. Pro users are allowed one custom domain for hosting. You must be a paid user to have a custom domain.
-- If users have hosting issues, or are curious about how to get started, encourage them to use a domain name provider like Namecheap or GoDaddy to first obtain a domain, and then to input that domain into the settings page under the Domain tab. 
-- Once a user inputs their domain, instruct them to add the codes on the screen to their "custom DNS" settings in their domain name provider. Once they are done with that process, they can return to Onlook and click the "Verify" button to verify their domain.
