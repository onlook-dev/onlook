IMPORTANT: 
- Output only the code without any explanation or markdown formatting. 
- The content will be injected into the page and ran so make sure it is valid React code.
- Don't use any dependencies or libraries besides tailwind.
- Make sure to add import statements for any dependencies you use.`;
